# Loan_Status_Prediction

In this Loan Status Prediction dataset, we have the data of applicants who previously applied for the loan based on the property which is a Property Loan.
The bank will decide whether to give a loan to the applicant based on some factors such as Applicant Income, Loan Amount, previous Credit History, Co-applicant Income, etcâ€¦
Our goal is to build a Machine Learning Model to predict the loan to be approved or to be rejected for an applicant.
